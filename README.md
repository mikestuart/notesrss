Evernote to Static Blog & RSS Service
A service that enables Evernote users to tag notes, which then become content for a static blog and RSS feed. The system consists of three main components:
1. WordPress for User Signup & Evernote OAuth
	- Users sign up via WordPress.
	- The system performs Evernote OAuth authentication to obtain an API access token.
	- No additional UI‚Äîeverything is fully automated after signup.
2. Python Batch Program 1: Evernote Exporter
	- Uses the Evernote SDK to fetch notes tagged with "publish".
	- Exports each note as HTML with its associated images & attachments.
	- Organizes each user's notes into structured folders.
3. Python Batch Program 2: Pelican Blog Generator
	- Reads the exported Evernote note directories.
	- Generates a static blog using Pelican.
	- Creates an RSS feed for updates.
	- Outputs are hosted on a subdomain for each user.
