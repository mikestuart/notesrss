 I combined chatGPT, perplexity and python to write news summaries
</p>
<p>
 the idea is to type in the niche (like &ldquo;AI&rdquo; or &ldquo;video games&rdquo; or &ldquo;fitness&rdquo;) and get related news for today. It works like this:
</p>
<p>
 1. python node defines today&rsquo;s date and sends it to chatgpt.
</p>
<p>
 2. chatgpt writes queries relevant to the niche + today&rsquo;s date and sends them to perplexity.
</p>
<p>
 3. perplexity finds media related to the niche (like this step, cause you can find most interesting news there) and searches for news.
</p>
<p>
 4. another chatgpt node summarizes and rewrites each news item into one sentence. It was tought to reach, cause sometimes gpt tries to give either too little or too much context.
</p>
<p>
 5. after the list of news, it adds the list of sources.
</p>
<p>
 depending on the niche the tool still gives either today&rsquo;s news or news close to the date, unfortunately I can&rsquo;t fix it yet.
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;ll share json file in comments, if someone is interested in details and wants to customize it with some other ai models (or hopefully help me with prompting for perplexity).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
 ps I want to make a daily podcast with the news but still choosing the tool for it.
