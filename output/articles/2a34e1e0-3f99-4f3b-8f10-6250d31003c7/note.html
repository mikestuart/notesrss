  Developers Max Brodeur-Urbas and Rahul Behal think that AI has the potential to automate lots of business-relevant tasks, but that many of the AI-powered automation tools on the market today are unreliable and costly. Part of the problem is that users expect too much of AI, Brodeur-Urbas told TechCrunch &mdash; for instance, they assume that it can handle highly specialized, niche workloads where precision matters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  &ldquo;If users ever want to use AI for enterprise purposes, the technology really has to have no margin for error,&rdquo; Brodeur-Urbas
  <a href="https://blog.gumloop.com/why-we-built-gumloop/">
   <span>
    said
   </span>
  </a>
  . &ldquo;Leaving specific workflows completely up to AI is not realistic. Users would be paying for [an AI] to spin its wheels performing the same Google search over and over again.&rdquo;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  Still, Brodeur-Urbas, an ex-Microsoft software engineer, and Behal, previously a software developer at Amazon Web Services, thought today&rsquo;s AI had promising narrower applications. So they started thinking about ways they could squeeze what Brodeur-Urbas called &ldquo;real value&rdquo; out of AI tech.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  These ideas became a wrapper for the open source app

  , then a proof-of-concept, and eventually a startup:
  <a href="https://www.gumloop.com/">
   <span>
    Gumloop
   </span>
  </a>
  . Gumloop automates repetitive workflows with AI, aiming to streamline basic tasks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  &ldquo;We started the company in a bedroom in Vancouver as a side project,&rdquo; Brodeur-Urbas said. &ldquo;We were trying to solve a very simple problem for a group of nontechnical people in a Discord server, and it spiraled into something larger than we could have ever imagined.&rdquo;
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  Gumloop provides a workflow builder that integrates with third-party apps and tools including GitHub, Gmail, Outlook, and X. Users can drag modular components onto a canvas to build automations, or choose from prebuilt pipelines for tasks like generating daily stock reports and summarizing documents.

   Brodeur-Urbas claims that teams at Instacart and Rippling are using Gumloop for various use cases.
  </span>
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  <span>
   &ldquo;Today, thousands of users rely on Gumloop as a core tool for their business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Giving nontechnical people the tools to solve their own problems without relying on engineers is where we found market pull.&rdquo;

   There&rsquo;s no shortage of workflow automation tools out there.

   and others, which promise to automate more complex tasks end-to-end.
  </span>
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  <span>
   To remain nimble, Gumloop plans to keep its team quite small. The company is hiring, but Brodeur-Urbas said that the plan is to cap headcount at 10 people.
  </span>
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  <span>
   &ldquo;Using AI to code let&nbsp;us have the throughput of a 20-person team and outpace competitors,&rdquo; he claimed. &ldquo;Our plan is to be a 10-person, billion-dollar company.&rdquo;
  </span>
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span>
  <span>
   As it prepares to relocate from Vancouver to San Francisco, Gumloop has closed a $17 million Series A round led by Nexus Venture Partners with participation from First Round Capital, Y Combinator, and angel investors including Instacart co-founder Max Mullen and Databricks co-founder and chief architect Reynold Xin. To date, Gumloop has raised $20 million in capital.

</p>
<p>
 <span>
  <span>
   &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t need the money at all,&rdquo; Brodeur-Urbas said. &ldquo;Raising money isn&rsquo;t the goal &mdash; building a product people love is. This new venture capital will help us build and scale that product even faster.&rdquo;
