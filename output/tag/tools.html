  Developers Max Brodeur-Urbas and Rahul Behal think that AI has the potential to automate lots of business-relevant tasks, but that many of the AI-powered automation tools on the market today are unreliable and costly. Part of the problem is that users expect too much of AI, Brodeur-Urbas told TechCrunch — for instance, they assume that it can handle highly specialized, niche workloads where precision matters.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
  “If users ever want to use AI for enterprise purposes, the technology really has to have no margin for error,” Brodeur-Urbas
  <a href="/articles/2a34e1e0-3f99-4f3b-8f10-6250d31003c7/attachments/">
<span>
    said
   </span>
</a>
  . “Leaving specific workflows completely up to AI is not realistic. Users would be paying for [an AI] to spin its wheels performing the same Google search over and over again.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
  Still, Brodeur-Urbas, an ex-Microsoft software engineer, and Behal, previously a software developer at Amazon Web Services, thought today’s AI had promising narrower applications. So they started thinking about ways they could squeeze what Brodeur-Urbas called “real value” out of AI tech.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
  These ideas became a wrapper for the open source app

<span>

  , then a proof-of-concept, and eventually a startup:
  <a href="/articles/2a34e1e0-3f99-4f3b-8f10-6250d31003c7/attachments/">
<span>
    Gumloop
   </span>
</a>
  . Gumloop automates repetitive workflows with AI, aiming to streamline basic tasks.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
  “We started the company in a bedroom in Vancouver as a side project,” Brodeur-Urbas said. “We were trying to solve a very simple problem for a group of nontechnical people in a Discord server, and it spiraled into something larger than we could have ever imagined.”
 </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
  Gumloop provides a workflow builder that integrates with third-party apps and tools including GitHub, Gmail, Outlook, and X. Users can drag modular components onto a canvas to build automations, or choose from prebuilt pipelines for tasks like generating daily stock reports and summarizing documents.

   Brodeur-Urbas claims that teams at Instacart and Rippling are using Gumloop for various use cases.
  </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
   “Today, thousands of users rely on Gumloop as a core tool for their business,” he said. “Giving nontechnical people the tools to solve their own problems without relying on engineers is where we found market pull.”
  </span>
</span>

<p>
<span>
<span>
   There’s no shortage of workflow automation tools out there.

<span>

   and others, which promise to automate more complex tasks end-to-end.
  </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
   To remain nimble, Gumloop plans to keep its team quite small. The company is hiring, but Brodeur-Urbas said that the plan is to cap headcount at 10 people.
  </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
   “Using AI to code let us have the throughput of a 20-person team and outpace competitors,” he claimed. “Our plan is to be a 10-person, billion-dollar company.”
  </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
   As it prepares to relocate from Vancouver to San Francisco, Gumloop has closed a $17 million Series A round led by Nexus Venture Partners with participation from First Round Capital, Y Combinator, and angel investors including Instacart co-founder Max Mullen and Databricks co-founder and chief architect Reynold Xin. To date, Gumloop has raised $20 million in capital.
  </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
   “We didn’t need the money at all,” Brodeur-Urbas said. “Raising money isn’t the goal — building a product people love is. This new venture capital will help us build and scale that product even faster.”
